Issue while while cloning repo: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
command to resolve the above issue
Open Git Bash and run the command if you want to completely disable SSL verification.

git config --global http.sslVerify false
Note: This solution opens you to attacks like man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore turn on verification again as soon as possible:

git config --global http.sslVerify true
